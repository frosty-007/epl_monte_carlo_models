    Extraction of disciplinary data (yellow/red cards, penalties)
    Incorporation of fixture-level context: derby flag, days between matches, European travel
    Integrating injury/suspension availability—sourcing APIs or manual input to adjust expected strength 
3. Lambda Calibration Logic
    How to transform raw expected goals into Poisson-lambda values
    Defining and weighting modifiers based on form, cards, injuries, fixture congestion, tactics, subsitutions

“λ-calibration logic”
In a Monte-Carlo football-simulation pipeline, λ (lambda) is the Poisson rate that governs how many goals a team is expected to score in a given match minute (or over the full 90 min, depending on your time step). Lambda-calibration logic is therefore the code that learns, updates and sanity-checks these Poisson rates before each simulation run, so that the synthetic seasons you generate stay anchored to real-world scoring patterns.

| Stage                                      | Typical questions the λ-calibration code answers                                | Common techniques                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Data prep**                           | Which matches do we trust? How far back?                                        | ETL + quality filters; time-decay weighting                                                                                            |
| **2. Baseline λ fit**                      | What is each team’s raw scoring & conceding rate?                               | Maximum-likelihood Poisson or Bayesian hierarchical Poisson models ([zeileis.org][1])                                                  |
| **3. Structural adjustment**               | How do we allow for home-advantage and opponent strength?                       | Dixon-Coles log-link:  $\log \lambda_{ij}=H + A_i - D_j$ (H = home boost, A = team-attack, D = team-defence) ([dashee87.github.io][2]) |
| **4. Low-score correction**                | Vanilla Poisson under-rates 0-0 & 1-1 draws—how do we fix that?                 | Dixon-Coles ρ-term or bivariate/Skellam tweaks                                                                                         |
| **5. Regularisation / shrinkage**          | How do we stop early-season noise from exploding λ?                             | Ridge/Lasso; Bayesian priors; Elo-style partial pooling                                                                                |
| **6. Back-test & calibration diagnostics** | Are simulated scorelines statistically indistinguishable from hold-out seasons? | Reliability diagrams, Brier score, PIT histograms                                                                                      |
| **7. Live update loop**                    | How do yesterday’s results nudge λ?                                             | EWMA or Kalman filter step, then re-normalise so league-wide mean goals ≈ historical average                                           |
